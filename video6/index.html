<!-- SEO stands for search engine optimization -->
<!-- Google is a search engine,it will show all that pages which serves good user experience

    Core web vitals are  also considered for a good user experience and these are:

    1)CLS (Cumulative Layout shift)
    CLS should be as min as possible for a good user experience,cls means when we click on a particular image and at that instance if another image gets loaded then we will accidentely end up clicking on that image instead of the previous one.

    2)LCP (Largest contentful paint)
    LCP metric reports the render time of the largest image or text block visible within the viewport,relative to when the page first started loading.
    A good LCP score is 2.5 sec.

    3)FID (First input Delay)
    The time from when a user first interacts with your page (when they clicked a link, tapped on a button, and so on) to the time when the browser responds to that interaction.
    This is important on pages where the user needs to do something, because this is the delay before the page becomes interactive.
    For a good user experience sites should have a FID of 100 milliseconds or less.

    <h2>Inline and Block Elements</h2>
    <p>In web development, "inline" and "block" are two types of HTML elements that describe how elements are displayed on a web page and how they interact with other elements.</p>

    <ol>

        <li>Inline Elements:Inline elements are elements that flow within the content of a web page and do not start on a new line. They only take up as much width as necessary to contain their content. </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Examples: &lt; a &gt;, &lt; span &gt;, &lt; strong &gt; and &lt; img &gt;</li>
            <li>You can place multiple inline elements side by side within the same line</li>
        </ul>

        <li>Block Elements:Block elements, on the other hand, start on a new line and create a "block" that takes up the full available width of their parent container by default.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Examples:&lt; div &gt;,&lt; p &gt;,&lt; h1 &gt; to &lt; h6 &gt;,&lt; ul &gt;,&lt; ol &gt; and &lt; li &gt;</li>
            <li>Block elements stack on top of each other vertically, creating a new block for each element, which
            pushes subsequent elements to a new line</li>

        </ul>
    
    </ol>
